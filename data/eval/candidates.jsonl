Bike is made for long days on the saddle, while being comfortable. Think comfy tractor, instead of stiff sports car. | Whenever I've done bikepacking trips, I get tired of hunting the next power outlet (once found, you have to hang by it for a bit too long), so I'm running a SON dynamo, with kLite lighting/charging setup. I'll have two battery packs for the \"oh sh*t\" moments. For navigation, I'll be using Wahoo Elemnt Bolt v2 (OsmAnd on my phone as backup).
